Extraterrestrial life, colloquially referred to as alien life, is life that may occur outside 
Earth and which did not originate on Earth. No extraterrestrial life has yet been conclusively 
detected, although efforts are underway. Such life might range from simple forms like prokaryotes 
to intelligent beings, possibly bringing forth civilizations that might be far more advanced than 
humankind.
 The Drake equation speculates about the existence of sapient life 
 elsewhere in the universe. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as astrobiology.

Speculation about the possibility of inhabited "worlds" outside the planet Earth dates back to 
antiquity. Multiple early Christian writers discussed the idea of a "plurality of worlds" as 
proposed by earlier thinkers such as Democritus; Augustine references Epicurus's idea of innumerable 
worlds "throughout the boundless immensity of space" (originally expressed in his Letter to Herodotus) 
in The City of God.[4] In his first century poem De rerum natura (Book 2:1048–1076), the Epicurean 
philosopher Lucretius predicted that we would find innumerable exoplanets with life-forms similar to, 
and different from, the ones on Earth, and even other races of man.[citation needed]

Pre-modern writers typically assumed that extraterrestrial "worlds" would be inhabited by living 
beings. William Vorilong, in the 15th century, acknowledged the possibility that Christ could have 
visited extraterrestrial worlds to redeem their inhabitants. Nicholas of Cusa wrote in 1440 
that the Earth was "a brilliant star" like other celestial objects visible in space, which would 
appear similar to the Sun from an exterior perspective due to a layer of "fiery brightness" in 
the outer layer of the atmosphere. He theorized that all extraterrestrial bodies could be inhabited 
by men, plants, and animals, including the Sun. Descartes wrote that there was no means to prove 
that the stars were not inhabited by "intelligent creatures," but their existence was a matter of 
speculation. The writings of these thinkers show that interest in extraterrestrial life existed 
throughout history, but it is only recently that humans have had any means of investigating it.

Since the mid-20th century, active research has taken place to look for signs of extraterrestrial 
life, encompassing searches for current and historic extraterrestrial life, and a narrower search
 for extraterrestrial intelligent life. Depending on the category of search, methods range from 
 the analysis of telescope and specimen data[8] to radios used to detect and send communication 
 signals.[citation needed]

The concept of extraterrestrial life, and particularly extraterrestrial intelligence, has had a major
 cultural impact, especially extraterrestrials in fiction. Over the years, science fiction has 
 communicated scientific ideas, imagined a wide range of possibilities, and influenced public 
 interest in and perspectives on extraterrestrial life. One shared space is the debate over the 
 wisdom of attempting communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. Some encourage aggressive 
 methods to try to contact intelligent extraterrestrial life. Others—citing the tendency of 
 technologically advanced human societies to enslave or wipe out less advanced societies—argue 
 that it may be dangerous to actively call attention to Earth.
